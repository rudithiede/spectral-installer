Spectral Installer
==================

Look busy to the untrained eye! Spectral Installer prints a bunch of
convincing-looking installer/compiler/download type bullshit to your terminal.
Impress your technologically challenged friends!

Use
===

After downloading, run "python path/to/spectral.py" in your terminal.

Warning
=======

As with all things, the way you use this project is up to you. This is all
just for fun. We strongly recommend you NOT to use it to slack off - you WILL
be caught, especially if your boss is a techie! We are not responsible for
anything you do with this script!

Goals
=====

Right now, only simple messages are being printed. To add some variety, we
still need:

- clear the screen (in a portable way) before running the process
- occasionally trigger verbose fake error/success messages
- progress percentages and/or bars of various kinds, to be triggered randomly
- occasional walls-o'-text
- very rarely, the screen should clear itself
- more lines of plausible-looking generic terminology
- give the user control over the speed at which messages print with an
  optional parameter
